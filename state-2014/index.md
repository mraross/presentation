# geocoding

Geocoding is the process of transforming input text, such as an address, or a name of a placeâ€”to a location on the earth's surface.

# reverse geocoding

Reverse geocoding is the opposite, it transforms your current geographic location in to a list of places nearby.

# ecosystem - free tier

<br />

- Google maps API (15,000/day)
- Yahoo (5,000/day)
- Nokia HERE (10,000 per day)
- opencagedata
- ... many more

---

# ecosystem - open source

<br />

- Nominatim
- Photon
- Two Fishes
- ??

---

# points of differentiation

- It's completely open-source and MIT licensed
- It's based on open-data, so you can run it yourself
- You can install it locally and modify to suit your needs
- It has an impressive list of features, such as fast autocomplete
- It's modular, so you don't need to be an expert to make changes
- It's easy to install and requires no external dependencies
- We run a continuous deployment cycle with a new version shipping weekly

---

# high level goals

- Provide accurate search results
- Give users query suggestions (typeahead in the search box)
- Account for location bias (places nearer to you appear higher in the results)
- Support multiple data sources (OSM, geonames, quattroshapes etc)
- Flexible software architecture
- Easy to contribute software patches and features to
- Easy to set-up and configure your own instance
- No external dependencies (such as postgres)
- Reliable, configurable & fast import process
- Work equally well for a small city and the entire planet

# quattroshapes

<br />

This work is based on foursquare checkins, geo tagged photos from Flickr, an extended version of Natural Earth, and open government data.

<br />

Concordance is provided between quattroshapes, geonames.org, and Yahoo! GeoPlanet unique IDs in the gazetteer.

# street addresses

- import pipeline for all (most) address data
- bundles together:
  - normalized address schema
  - address deduplication
  - suggester payload addition
- imports:
  - *OpenAddresses*
  - *OSM*
  - *TIGER*
  - etc.
- simplify the process of running custom imports

# retrospective

- geonames, what is the quality
- quattro, excellent but needs quality review
- osm import speed issues
- versioning

---

# roadmap

- search quality
 - classification capital/city/transport/cafe etc.
 - population weights

- data visualization tools
- ease of imports

- split polygons & intersections to new repo?
  - import osm boundaries?
  - quattroshapes fixes work

- integrating addresses pipeline with osm/pelias (@severyn)

- open issues:
  - guesswho
    - global suggest
  - node-osmium

- use cases
  - closest food
  - airports
  - postcodes


- ngram?

- aliases?
