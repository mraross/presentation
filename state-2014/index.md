# geocoding

Geocoding is the process of transforming input text, such as an address, or a name of a placeâ€”to a location on the earth's surface.

---

# reverse geocoding

Reverse geocoding is the opposite, it transforms your current geographic location in to a list of places nearby.

# points of differentiation

- It's completely open-source and MIT licensed
- It's based on open-data, so you can run it yourself
- You can install it locally and modify to suit your needs
- It has an impressive list of features, such as fast autocomplete
- It's modular, so you don't need to be an expert to make changes
- It's easy to install and requires no external dependencies
- We run a continuous deployment cycle with a new version shipping weekly

---

# high level goals

- Provide accurate search results
- Give users query suggestions (typeahead in the search box)
- Account for location bias (places nearer to you appear higher in the results)
- Support multiple data sources (OSM, geonames, quattroshapes etc)
- Flexible software architecture
- Easy to contribute software patches and features to
- Easy to set-up and configure your own instance
- No external dependencies (such as postgres)
- Reliable, configurable & fast import process
- Work equally well for a small city and the entire planet

# quattroshapes

<br />

This work is based on foursquare checkins, geo tagged photos from Flickr, an extended version of Natural Earth, and open government data.

<br />

Concordance is provided between quattroshapes, geonames.org, and Yahoo! GeoPlanet unique IDs in the gazetteer.

# FST

![fst](http://www.elasticsearch.org/content/uploads/2013/08/suggest_1.png)

# api

- endpoints
  - /search
  - /suggest
  - /reverse
  - /hierarchy
- modifiers
  - ?size=
  - ?layers=
  - ?lat=&lon=
- public contributions

---

# search logic

- just nearby
  - geodistance from lat/lon
- results from neighboring cities/states/countries
  - uses different precision levels (5+3+1)
- include admin values
  - based on the zoom level
  - Ex: show countries at zoom<8 & neighborhoods zoom 12+
- taking weights into account
  - admin1 > neighborhood > osmnode > geoname
- fuzzy matching
  - generates an edit distance based on the search term length
  - 'layd moody' -> 'lady moody', 'maysbille' -> 'maysville'

---

# search logic (experimental)

- search term analysis on the fly
- if search term starts with a number, prioritize street addresses
- if search term is less than x characters without a space, show higher admins
- tokenize on comma and ignore the tokens that follow
- improve general search quality based on relevance & feedback (future)

---

# search quality

- what does good search quality mean?
  - personalization?
  - being smart (creepy?)
  - doing the right thing (what?)
- testing
  - unit tests
  - regression testing

---

# addresses pipeline

- import pipeline for all (most) address data
- bundles together:
  - normalized address schema
  - address deduplication
  - suggester payload addition
- imports:
  - *OpenAddresses*
  - *OSM*
  - *TIGER*
  - etc.

---

# custom address imports

- abstracts away boilerplate, manual configuration
- simplify custom address imports for users
- cut redundancy in our import codebase

---

# addresses: future

- currently running test imports
- next step might be a geocoder for the US
- iterate, integrate into production

# operations

### overview

- config management with Chef/Opsworks
- monitoring via Sensu/Cloudwatch/Pingdom
 - standard host metrics alerting
 - cluster state
 - ELB unhealthy hosts
- multiple independent systems
 - switchover via DNS (Route53)

---

# operations

### index metrics

- 62.3 million documents
- 371GB on disk (with 1 replica)
- 64GB FST size (down from ~190GB)

---

![stats](https://fd-files-production.s3.amazonaws.com/70073/nd1azQDR8GKp3qwZ9JAmqQ?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIA2QBI5WP5HA3ZEA&Signature=Gd0GntKrb82BELuJ4aB%2BnLRFSIA%3D&Expires=1418229499)

---

# operations

### architecture

- Internet >> (ELB) Repose >> (ELB) API >> (ELB) Elasticsearch
 - Repose: rate limiting proxy, java, on the fly config changes
 - Elasticsearch: 1.3.4
  - sharding determined largely by memory requirements which currently dictate node count
  - replicas for redundancy
   - more replicas influence FST requirements

---

# operations

### concerns

- load testing
- data ingestion time
- rollback
 - grace period on old cluster before new load?
 - index snapshots?

- osm import speed issues
- versioning

---

# roadmap

 - classification capital/city/transport/cafe etc.
 - population weights

- data visualization tools
- ease of imports

- split polygons & intersections to new repo?
  - import osm boundaries?
  - quattroshapes fixes work

---

# roadmap continued

<br />

- integrating addresses pipeline with osm/pelias (@severyn)

- open issues:
  - guesswho
    - global suggest
  - node-osmium

- ngram?

- aliases?

---

# community

- triage + assignment
- booking some speaking events (@alyssa)
