# Geocoding

Geocoding is the process of transforming input text, such as an address, or a name of a placeâ€”to a location on the earth's surface.

---

# Reverse geocoding

Reverse geocoding is the opposite, it transforms your current geographic location in to a list of places nearby.

- has a feature rich **geographic API** built in
- supports **multilingual language analysis**
- capable of **peformant full text search**

---

# search logic

- just nearby
  - geodistance from lat/lon
- results from neighboring cities/states/countries
  - uses different precision levels (5+3+1)
- include admin values
  - based on the zoom level
  - Ex: show countries at zoom<8 & neighborhoods zoom 12+
- taking weights into account
  - admin1 > neighborhood > osmnode > geoname
- fuzzy matching
  - generates an edit distance based on the search term length
  - 'layd moody' -> 'lady moody', 'maysbille' -> 'maysville'

---

# search logic (experimental)

- search term analysis on the fly
- if search term starts with a number, prioritize street addresses
- if search term is less than x characters without a space, show higher admins
- tokenize on comma and ignore the tokens that follow
- improve general search quality based on relevance & feedback (future)

---

# search quality

- what does good search quality mean?
  - personalization?
  - being smart (creepy?)
  - doing the right thing (what?)
- testing
  - unit tests
  - regression testing

# addresses pipeline

- import pipeline for all (most) address data
- bundles together:
  - normalized address schema
  - address deduplication
  - suggester payload addition
- imports:
  - *OpenAddresses*
  - *OSM*
  - *TIGER*
  - etc.

---

# custom address imports

- abstracts away boilerplate, manual configuration
- simplify custom address imports for users
- cut redundancy in our import codebase

---

# addresses: future

- currently running test imports
- next step might be a geocoder for the US
- iterate, integrate into production

# operations

### overview

- config management with Chef/Opsworks
- monitoring via Sensu/Cloudwatch/Pingdom
 - standard host metrics alerting
 - cluster state
 - ELB unhealthy hosts
- multiple independent systems
 - switchover via DNS (Route53)

---

# operations

### index metrics

- 62.3 million documents
- 371GB on disk (with 1 replica)
- 64GB FST size (down from ~190GB)

---

---

# operations

### architecture

- Internet >> (ELB) Repose >> (ELB) API >> (ELB) Elasticsearch
 - Repose: rate limiting proxy, java, on the fly config changes
 - Elasticsearch: 1.3.4
  - sharding determined largely by memory requirements which currently dictate node count
  - replicas for redundancy
   - more replicas influence FST requirements

---

# operations

### concerns

- load testing
- data ingestion time
- rollback
 - grace period on old cluster before new load?
 - index snapshots?

# retrospective

- geonames, what is the quality
- quattro, excellent but needs quality review
- osm import speed issues
- versioning

---

# roadmap

- search quality
 - classification capital/city/transport/cafe etc.
 - population weights

- data visualization tools
- ease of imports

- split polygons & intersections to new repo?
  - import osm boundaries?
  - quattroshapes fixes work

---

# roadmap continued

<br />

- integrating addresses pipeline with osm/pelias (@severyn)

- open issues:
  - guesswho
    - global suggest
  - node-osmium

- ngram?

- aliases?

---

# community

- triage + assignment
- booking some speaking events (@alyssa)
- waffle.io?
- gitter?
