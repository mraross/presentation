Pelias is a modular open-source geocoder using ElasticSearch for fast autocomplete and forward and reverse geocoding. It is written in node.js for modularity, streams and ease of use. Streams are like unix pipes - they handle reading/writing to relatively slow interfaces and provide a nice abstraction. With node streams, we read our geospatial data, transform them and put them in elasticsearch and not worry about handling back pressure. Writing modular software using node.js is pretty straight forward and powerful - this lets us support a mix of open datasets (such as OpenStreetMap, Geonames, and OpenAddresses) while flexible enough to also work with proprietary datasets. We believe the best way to build locally relevant and accurate geographic search is in the open--which is why we're building an open source geocoder that anyone can build and run themselves.
